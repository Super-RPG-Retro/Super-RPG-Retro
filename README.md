## About.

The software information at this website might be outdated, might no longer exist or might be incorrect. Super RPG retro is not yet finished. It's an ongoing project, full of bugs, spelling mistakes, bad grammar, and possibly some spaghetti code.

Game inspired by Lufia 2 and Legacy of the ancients. Game programmed in Godot 4.1.

The Super RPG Retro client has four main categories. Builder, Play, Settings System and Settings Game are accessed at the main menu.

The saved game data is not saved to disk using ResourceSaver. Instead, data is encrypted using JSON for security.

Here is a small list of software programming things to do.

- Chat feature for gameplay.
- Encyclopedia of enemies.
- Story and story in summary form.
- Secret floor tile event.
- Used double comments.
- Write clean code using the [DRY, KISS and SOLID principles.](https://godottutorials.com/courses/design-principles/). See also [project Programming](project-programming.md) for more information.

See the complete list of software programming things to do at the [TODO](TODO.md) page.

This game is programmed in GDScript instead of c#. The original author of this game believes simplicity is more important than speed.

Currently, only two dungeon levels work after game installation. Those levels are used to test game features.

Game play can be configured to look exactly the same every time you play it or the game play can have randomness added to it. You can change the size of rooms in each dungeon level.

After upgrading the game from Godot 3.2 to 4.1, some game features do not work as intended. Some features no longer work. Some features such as chat were disabled. After upgrading the game, chat now needs to be rewritten. Minimap is not completely working. An error was discovered in minimap while upgrading to Godot 4.1 and now that minimap feature needs to be rewritten.

The core of this game came from this video, building a Roguelike from Scratch in Godot, [Dungeon of Recycling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ1UGbUlzH4). Most images, such as, enemies and magic, and the game UI design idea, came from [Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup.](https://crawl.develz.org/)

## Builder.

This game has a Builder feature accessed from within the game. Builder is the word used in super RPG retro to refer to a game construction kit, also known as a game maker. Builder is used to create a game to play later.

### Things Builder can do.

Builder has a setting at the level menu called parent_container. Currently 99 parent_container can be selected.

The parent_container has four child settings.

- Dungeon_number: The current dungeon selected.

- Level_number: The current level to be edited.

- Is_enabled: Is this parent container enabled at gameplay? Toggles visibility of the child container.

- Child_container: All other settings related to the parent container are displayed here.

Changing the parent container value will change every setting at this scene.

Changing the dungeon number setting or level number setting will change every setting at the child container.

The current events are...

- Inventory: Give the selected items to player.
- Puzzle: Solved by color. Puzzle game similar to the Lufia 2 game.
- Tasks: Receive gold, experience or money after the task is complete.
- Story: Display the selected text to the user.
- Locked doors: Set an event room door as locked. Select the key to open it.

In Super RPG Retro client, you can set the amount of dungeons to be played, set the amount of levels in a dungeon, set the amount of rooms in a dungeon level, set the contents inside a room and set a corridor as hidden.

### How's things work in Builder.

A 2d maze is procedurally generated but uses Builder user defined values, such as, room size and number of items in a room while the 3D maze is created in Builder by positioning blocks in a 2d grid.

Currently the 2D maze is where enemies and events will be, while the 3D maze, similar to Legacy of the ancients, will use different keys for Dungeon access.

## Settings Game.

A settings game access from the Super RPG Retro main menu hold settings for the playable game. The settings game button will be hidden when a playable game has saved data.

The difficulty level of a new game can be changed at the settings game. Changing most settings at that scene will change the value of the difficulty level feature, the higher the value of the difficulty level feature, the more difficult the game play will be.

A secret word is given to the player after the player wins a game. Every value of the difficulty level feature will give a different secret word to the player. That secret word can be used for many reasons, such as...

- A prize to the first person that finishes the game.

- A secret code to unlock special things for the next new playable game.

If the settings game button at the main menu was always visible, the user could cheat.

## Settings System.

The Setting System scene holds general settings for all areas of the Super RPG Retro client. The value of the difficulty level feature cannot be changed at this scene.

Dungeon levels are procedurally generated using seeds. The seeds at Settings System are...

- Use a random seed. A high probability chance that a dungeon level will not look exactly like before.

- Use a static seed. All dungeon levels will look exactly like before.

- Use seed from Builder. All dungeon levels will look exactly like before. A user can design some or all dungeon levels to look unique or identical to each other.

Levels with the same seed value will look identical when their room properties are identical in value.
