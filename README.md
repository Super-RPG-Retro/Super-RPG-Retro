### Summary
This game is currently a work in progress and programmed in Godot 3.5. Currently, only two dungeon levels work after game installation. Those levels are used to test game features. The idea is to make a challenging game loaded full of events, such as, trap doors, puzzles, and tasks.

The core of this game came from this video, building a Roguelike from Scratch in Godot, [Dungeon of Recycling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ1UGbUlzH4). 

Game play can be configured to look exactly the same every time you play it or the game play can have randomness added to it. You can change the size of the rooms in each dungeon level. Each dungeon level can have a puzzle room. Six mobs movement type, such as, avoid player and trace walls.

* In-game construction kit, called builder.
* Hundreds of customizable features.
* Every game can have a different "difficulty level" value
* Client panel has in-game chat and help commands.
* 61 magic. 999 maximum runes can be stacked for any magic item.
* 460 items can be used in inventory. You can add to this list.
* 678 mobs. You can add to this list.
* 99 levels in every dungeon.
* 8 dungeons.
* 10 player statistics such as str, def and luc.
* 999 is the maximum value of a statistic.
* 999 is the maximum level a player can have.
* 9999 is the maximum value for both HP and MP.
* Dungeon can be procedurally generated by using a seed.
* Set the game to use the same seed. 1000000000 available seeds.
* Enable music globally.
* Enable sound globally.
* Enable wind and water drop sounds.
* Toggle size of the player stats panel.
* Show more of the main map by showing less of the client panel.
* Customize the client panel.
* Show guide images on the map where a rune can be casted.
* Cast the rune at the main map or have instant rune casting.
* Hide the dungeon corridor stone walls?
* Try to show only the stone walls that parameter the corridor?
* Remove every one tile wide stone tile that borders the level.
* Should the graphics at the dungeon map be displayed larger?
* Higher values can increase the corridor distance between rooms.
* Trigger events based on time. Dungeons can get dark at night.
* Game difficulty. 1: Easy. 5: Extremely difficult.
* On: Mobs chase when they see you: Off: Chase anytime.
* A black map hiding unexplored dungeon areas.
* Mobs are seen in the room when the room door is closed?
* Items are seen in the room when the room door is closed?
* Mobs are dead when they are this many units from their starting position.
* mobs will respawn after these many game turn elapses.
* mobs can run out of the room or stay in the room.
* A black ceiling can be placed overtop of a dungeon room.
* Can use different floor tiles.
* Instant battle or turn based battle system.
* Can show the down ladder when the room ceiling is enabled.
* Option for the player to return to the last level of a dungeon.
* Option to continue a saved game.

Currently, some features do not work as intended and some places in code are spaghetti. The idea is to update this game to Godot 4.1. The code will then be organized using the DRY, KISS and SOILD principles for future programmers. See [project Programming](project-programming.md) for more information.
