# About.

You can configure the game system, game settings, or use the game construction kit called builder. Every feature at game settings will change the difficulty score.

The program has many things fo configure, such as, each dungeon level could have a puzzle room. There are six mob movement type that can be assigned to a mob, such as, avoid player and trace walls. Mobs could be configured to stay in room or follow the player. A room ceiling could be enabled. A random corridor could be hidden. 

The idea is to make a large, challenging game loaded full of events, such as, chat dialogs, many different puzzles, and mob tasks. 

Currently, only two dungeon levels work after game installation. Those levels are used to test game features.

Game play can be configured to look exactly the same every time you play it or the game play can have randomness added to it. You can change the size of the rooms in each dungeon level.

After upgrading the game from Godot 3.2 to 4.2 dev1, some game features do not work as intended. Some features no longer work. Some features such as chat were disabled. After upgrading the game, chat now needs to be rewritten. Minimap was also disabled. An error was discovered in minimap while upgrading to Godot 4.2 dev1 and now that minimap feature needs to be rewritten.

The core of this game came from this video, building a Roguelike from Scratch in Godot, [Dungeon of Recycling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ1UGbUlzH4). Most images, such as, mobs and magic, and the game UI design idea, came from [Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup.](https://crawl.develz.org/)

The game has a fair amount of spaghetti code. Some code jumps from scene to scene. Some code blocks are redundant. The code will now be organized using the [DRY, KISS and SOLID principles.](https://godottutorials.com/courses/design-principles/) See also [project Programming](project-programming.md) for more information.
